# TODO List

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Add reflection evaluation to the logger module. 
  - *Details: every state already contains the reflections so just a transition between wrong and right at the end of puzzle is needed.*
- [ ] Study which methods are suitable for which tasks for error classification.
- [ ] Add the suitable error classifier for each task.
- [ ] Search for visualisation methods.
- [ ] Add a visualisation module.
